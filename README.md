# Random-Word-and-short-cut-generator
This is a Random word generator, which helps you retrieve some few letter spanned word for any purpose. Suppose you have thought of a product or an idea for a company and you need some some nice catchy title for it. Then this program would help you suggest them to you non-stop unless you are convinced by it or you want the program to terminate. This is the main concept and the prototype has achieved 50% of the main concept. The program will show any words for now which may be irrelevant to your subject. I'll be working on it in which i'll add a subject section which which will show you words related to your need and the program will be capable of using the internet as the database. For now i've a local inbuilt database for testing purpose.

New update: In this update I'm working on requesting sites such as dictionary where I would be gathering antonyms of the update
and formulate the word structure accordingly.
However, I'm stuck in getting the response from the page when I ping a word.
Any help regarding this would be very much appreciated.
I'm uploading the java file named CreateWordDataSet which has this implementation.
